## Frontend for a Planner uni project.

This is the front-end of UniPlanner's system. Here is the [`link`](https://github.com/Sunrise443/BackendForSchedule) to our backend part of the project.
Tries to connect both frontend and backend parts can be found in some of the recent commits made on dev branch.

## Description

This is the user interface part of a desktop dairy platform. Write notes, add plans and goals to your calendar. 

## Design

You can explore the figma prototype our team designer made for this project [`here`](https://www.figma.com/proto/KGQu3b3lkwljwjzvUW9HCJ/diary?node-id=2104-8&starting-point-node-id=2104%3A8)

## Note

(The development process lacked some testing and the team couldn't make the interface adaptive within deadline, so it only looks `great` on 1366x768 screens. See the design)

## Content
